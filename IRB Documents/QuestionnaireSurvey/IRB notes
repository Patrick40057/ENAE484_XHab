Abstract?
This project looks to understand how 2-4 test subjects in different habitat sizes are able to complete a set of tasks. The experiments 
are to be completed with the materials available to them in storage inside “racks”. These racks include the essential items that a crew 
would need to complete a week to 30 day long mission. The experiments include completing and interacting with medical procedures, food 
and water preparation, exercise, tool storage, robot control, operating in a glove box, sleeping quarters. One of the ways this is 
evaluated is through motion capture to view how much space each subject requires to complete a set of experiments.
