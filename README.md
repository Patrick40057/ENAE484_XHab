# ENAE484_XHab
 This is a repository for Class of 2020 X-Hab Capstone Projecct revision and repository control. 
Unfortunately, due to the non-binary nature of NX files, collaboration between individuals in sub 
teams is going to be necessary to avoid merge conflicts (i.e. when two individuals work on the 
same assmebly file at the same time). If this occurs, one person's adjustments must be discarded
to be able to keep the repository moving. 

Additionally, please make comments with every commit to your branch so everyone can be up to date
with what changes were made. 

More subfolders can (and should) be made as we progress through the project, potentially such as
a Matlab folder or a Big Picture CAD program.
